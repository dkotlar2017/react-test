# Redesign Health Interview Project

If you are opening this project prior to the interview make sure you can set it up in 
your favorite Editor/IDE.

1. Make sure you have node.js installed first (version `8` or `10` is recommended).
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project in your browser

Once you have it running, you're all set! We'll share more specific guidelines about what you will build during
the interview.

If this is your first react project we recommend checking out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
If you have experience using a similar framework let us know during the interview -- we'll be sure
to provide extra guidance around React as we work through the problem.
